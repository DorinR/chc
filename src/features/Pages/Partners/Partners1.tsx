      <p>
        ICAO’s Technical Co-operation Programme provides advice and assistance
        in the development and implementation of projects across the full
        spectrum of civil aviation aimed at the safety, security, environmental
        protection and sustainable development of national and international
        civil aviation. The Programme is conducted under the broad policy
        guidance of the ICAO Assembly and of the Council. Subject to general
        guidance by the Secretary General, the Technical Co-operation Programme
        is executed by the Technical Co-operation Bureau (TCB).
      </p>

      <p>
        Since its establishment in 1952, TCB has implemented civil aviation
        projects with an accumulated value in excess of US$ 2 billion. With an
        average annual programme size of over US$ 120 million, it is involved in
        approximately 250 projects each year with individual project budgets
        ranging from less than US$ 20 000 to over US$ 120 million. To date, TCB
        has provided assistance to over 115 countries, deploying annually
        approximately 1200 international and national experts.
      </p>

      <p>
        As part of ICAO, a non-profit organization, TCB can offer its services
        under most favourable and cost-effective conditions. It guarantees
        strict neutrality, objectivity, and transparency, as it does not
        represent any particular national or commercial interest, nor the
        interest of any donor in general. Its advice is therefore governed by
        objective technical and financial considerations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Policy on ICAO Implementation Support provided to States: The Policy on
        ICAO Implementation Support provided to States was approved by the ICAO
        Council during its 225th Session in March 2022. Designed to strengthen
        the coordination and management of ICAO’s implementation support
        activities to better meet the needs of Member States and non-State
        entities, the Policy will ensure that the support provided is consistent
        in content and delivery regardless of the source of assistance or the
        associated funding mechanism and guide TCB in the implementation of
        technical cooperation and technical assistance projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover, the Implementation Support Policy aims to strengthen the
        Organization’s goal to deliver as One-ICAO. This implies a
        well-coordinated and consistent approach for delivering implementation
        support based on the needs of States. To manage complexity and deliver
        implementation support across all areas of civil aviation, the ICAO
        Secretariat will cooperate and collaborate efficiently and effectively
        with internal and external stakeholders, avoiding duplication and
        optimizing the allocation of resources.
