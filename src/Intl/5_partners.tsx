    `<h1>Technical Cooperation Bureau (ICAO/OACI) Montreal,Canada</h1>

  <p>
    ICAO’s Technical Co-operation Programme provides advice and assistance
    in the development and implementation of projects across the full
    spectrum of civil aviation aimed at the safety, security, environmental
    protection and sustainable development of national and international
    civil aviation. The Programme is conducted under the broad policy
    guidance of the ICAO Assembly and of the Council. Subject to general
    guidance by the Secretary General, the Technical Co-operation Programme
    is executed by the Technical Co-operation Bureau (TCB).
  </p>

  <p>
    Since its establishment in 1952, TCB has implemented civil aviation
    projects with an accumulated value in excess of US$ 2 billion. With an
    average annual programme size of over US$ 120 million, it is involved in
    approximately 250 projects each year with individual project budgets
    ranging from less than US$ 20 000 to over US$ 120 million. To date, TCB
    has provided assistance to over 115 countries, deploying annually
    approximately 1200 international and national experts.
  </p>

  <p>
    As part of ICAO, a non-profit organization, TCB can offer its services
    under most favourable and cost-effective conditions. It guarantees
    strict neutrality, objectivity, and transparency, as it does not
    represent any particular national or commercial interest, nor the
    interest of any donor in general. Its advice is therefore governed by
    objective technical and financial considerations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Policy on ICAO Implementation Support provided to States: The Policy on
    ICAO Implementation Support provided to States was approved by the ICAO
    Council during its 225th Session in March 2022. Designed to strengthen
    the coordination and management of ICAO’s implementation support
    activities to better meet the needs of Member States and non-State
    entities, the Policy will ensure that the support provided is consistent
    in content and delivery regardless of the source of assistance or the
    associated funding mechanism and guide TCB in the implementation of
    technical cooperation and technical assistance projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moreover, the Implementation Support Policy aims to strengthen the
    Organization’s goal to deliver as One-ICAO. This implies a
    well-coordinated and consistent approach for delivering implementation
    support based on the needs of States. To manage complexity and deliver
    implementation support across all areas of civil aviation, the ICAO
    Secretariat will cooperate and collaborate efficiently and effectively
    with internal and external stakeholders, avoiding duplication and
    optimizing the allocation of resources.

    members operate nearly 2000 airports. ACI-NA advocates policies and
    provides services that strengthen the ability of commercial airports to
    serve their passengers, customers, and communities. ACI-NA professional
    staff in the government affairs, legal, environment, safety, security,
    operations, and technical departments, works to ensure that legislation
    and regulations enacted in Washington, D.C., and Ottawa, help airports
    operate more safely and efficiently.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the Voice of Airports, it is ACI-NA’s mission to advocate policies
    and provide services that strengthen commercial airports’ ability to
    serve their passengers, customers, and communities. The organization
    works diligently to promote cooperation within the commercial civil
    aviation industry, encourage the exchange of ideas and experiences on
    common airport issues, identify and interpret current industry trends
    and practices, and establish forums for building professional
    relationships and disseminating key airport policy and business
    insights.
  </p>

  <p>
    Advocacy: The dedicated teams in Government Affairs, Legal,
    Environmental, Safety, Security, Operations, and Technical departments

    standards. Key surveys include the Airport Capital Development Costs
    Study, the annual North American Traffic Report, and the annual Airport
    Performance Benchmarking Survey. Networking: With 17 active committees,
    airport officials are kept abreast of the latest information on
    regulatory and industry issues. These committees play a pivotal role in
    developing policies, legislation, and regulatory comments for the
    airport industry's benefit. They also foster discussions on shared
    interests and plan conference programs relevant to challenges faced by
    North American airports.
