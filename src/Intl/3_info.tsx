    `<h1>Geography and Climate</h1>
    <p>
      Canada spans six time zones and is bordered by three oceans—the
      Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic. Its vast landscape is a tapestry of
      majestic mountains, dense forests, sprawling prairies, and intricate
      waterways. From the rugged Rocky Mountains to the serene Maritime
      coasts, Canada's geography is as diverse as it is expansive.
      Climate-wise, the country is known for its cold winters, especially in
      the northern regions, but it also experiences a wide range of climatic
      conditions. Coastal British Columbia, for instance, enjoys milder
      winters due to Pacific Ocean currents, while central Canada often faces
      hot summers and cold winters.

    <h1>Demographics and Culture</h1>
    <p>
      Canada is home to over 37 million people, with a cultural fabric woven
      from Indigenous communities, European settlers, and a wide array of
      immigrant groups. This diversity is celebrated through various
      festivals, music, art, and culinary traditions. Officially bilingual,
      Canada recognizes both English and French as its primary languages,
      especially in the province of Quebec, where French culture and language
      thrive. The nation's multicultural ethos is reflected in its policies,
      education, and everyday interactions, making it a global exemplar of
      cultural harmony.

    <h1>Political System and Governance</h1>
    <p>
      Operating as a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional
      monarchy, Canada's political structure is both unique and effective.
      Queen Elizabeth II serves as the symbolic head of state, while real
      political power resides with elected officials. The country has ten
      provinces and three territories, each with its own regional government.
      The Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a cornerstone of the Canadian
      constitution, guarantees fundamental rights and ensures that the nation
      remains a beacon of democracy and civil liberties.

    <h1>Educational and Healthcare Systems</h1>

      world's top universities and research institutions. Education is
      primarily a provincial responsibility, and the country takes pride in
      its high literacy rates and globally recognized academic programs.
      Similarly, the Canadian healthcare system, based on the principle of
      universal coverage, ensures that all residents have access to essential
      medical services without direct charges at the point of care. This
      commitment to health and education underscores Canada's dedication to
      the well-being of its citizens.

      Sports play a pivotal role in Canadian culture, with hockey often
      referred to as the nation's winter pastime. The National Hockey League
      (NHL), which features a significant number of Canadian teams, has a
      massive following, and events like the Stanley Cup playoffs become
      national spectacles. Beyond professional leagues, children and adults
      alike engage in hockey at local rinks, embodying the sport's grassroots
      spirit. Aside from hockey, Canada has made its mark in other sports like
      lacrosse, basketball, and curling, further solidifying its sporting
      legacy.

    <h1>Natural Resources and Economy</h1>

      Canada's economic strength is anchored in its abundant natural
      resources. The nation is a leading exporter of goods such as timber,
      minerals, and oil. The Alberta oil sands, in particular, are a major
      contributor to the economy. However, Canada's economic prowess isn't
      limited to resource extraction. The country has a burgeoning tech
      industry, a robust financial sector, and a dynamic service industry.
      With its stable economy and commitment to innovation, Canada continues
      to be an influential player on the global stage.
